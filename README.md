A Lan Party Management Tool; no more losing your voice in a few hours. Conduct votes somewhat quietly and painlessly. Provides basic managment tools for quickly starting and stopping configured game servers. All features are working and fully implimented. A matching back end UI is still needed but the system is otherwise fully functional.
